# AOW3 Worklog

Task ID: 1
Agent: Super Z (main)
Task: Browser-playable Art of War 3 — asset-fidelity pass (walk/fire anims, rotors, decorations, 1:1 strategy)

Work Log:
- Environment was reset between sessions (workspace + extraction folders lost). Recovered
  everything from the AOW3 GitHub repo: re-cloned, pulled XAPK (259MB) + extraction zip via LFS.
- Answered the 1:1 strategy question: Unity WebGL rebuild is impossible without the original
  editor project (APK ships only compiled ARM64 IL2CPP + assets); deeper native decompilation
  cannot rebuild a game. The max-fidelity path = asset-level remake (extracted models/skeletons/
  clips/atlases rendered by Three.js + recovered damage formulas) — already the architecture here.
- Diagnosed why the game still didn't look 1:1 (live QA + screenshots):
  1) Decor props rendered as opaque dark cards -> the GLB assembler's per-prop atlas crops were
     wrong AND alpha was flattened. Root cause: ETC1 split-alpha (materials use _MainTex +
     _MaskTex; previous pipeline ignored _MaskTex and mis-cropped).
  2) Fog of war was hard-edged (NearestFilter + alpha 232).
  3) Lighting washed out (sun 2.7 + ACES + exposure 1.12) and canopy undersides near-black.
  4) Unit animation state machine never started idle clips (v.loco initialized "idle").
  5) 5 GLBs carried skin references without JOINTS_0/WEIGHTS_0 -> "skinning disabled" warnings.
- Rebuilt the whole decoration pipeline (pipeline/tools/fix_decor.py):
  * unpack_bundles.py — XAPK -> 30 Unity bundles (incl. decorations_jungle/desert/common)
  * Merged shared RGBA atlases from _MainTex + _MaskTex pairs (jungle, jungle2, desert, war,
    jungleground, jungleground2) -> docs/assets/models/atlas-*.png
  * Exported ALL 688 props (vs 130 before) as tiny untextured GLBs with ORIGINAL UVs;
    index.json now carries per-prop mat->atlas routing (renderers ship Default-Material,
    so routing follows group/bundle like the original game).
  * game.js preloadDecor: loads shared atlases once, assigns maps by material name, alphaTest
    0.45 cutout (exactly how the original renders its cutout foliage).
- Fixed fog of war: LinearFilter + softer alphas (explored 92, unexplored 212).
- Fixed lighting (verified live via debug hook): hemi 0.9->1.5, sun 2.7->1.85, exposure 1.12->1.0.
- Fixed unit animations: loco init "idle" -> null so idle1 loop starts at spawn; verified live
  that real clips play (current: "idle1" when standing, "move" when walking; fire/oneshot paths
  intact: move_shoot / w1_round / w2_round / die_bullet).
- Helicopter rotors verified wired: f1 matches b_wing1-6, f2 matches "fan", spin 30 rad/s.
- Stripped dead skin refs from f1_bld_bunker, f1_bld_power, f1_veh_hammer, f1_veh_zeus,
  f2_avia_helicopter (rigid render, no more GLTFLoader warnings).
- Full local QA via agent-browser: zero page errors, screenshots confirm authentic cutout jungle
  decor, working walk/idle animations, soft fog, correct exposure.

Stage Summary:
- Deliverable: updated docs/ (game.js + 688 decor GLBs + 6 shared atlases) deployed from main:/docs.
- All 656 jungle prop meshes (plus desert/common) now exported and shipped; game scatters a themed
  subset per map. Unit skeletal clips (idle/move/move_shoot/w1_round/w2_round/die) play from the
  game's real AnimationClips; helicopter rotors spin procedurally.
- Strategy answer on record: 1:1 in-browser = asset-level remake (this), not Unity WebGL (needs
  original project) or full native decompile (months, still no visuals).
